# db/processing_lock.py — Distributed Processing Lock using Supabase
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Prevents the same customer session from being processed simultaneously
#   across multiple workers. Replaces the in-memory _processing_sessions set.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
#   acquire_lock() -> INSERT a row with session_id as PRIMARY KEY
#                    If insert succeeds -> lock acquired (safe to process)
#                    If insert fails (duplicate key) -> already locked -> skip
#
#   release_lock() -> DELETE the row when processing is done
#
# CRASH SAFETY:
#   A background cleanup removes stale locks older than 2 minutes.
#   This handles the case where the server crashed mid-pipeline
#   and release_lock() never ran.
